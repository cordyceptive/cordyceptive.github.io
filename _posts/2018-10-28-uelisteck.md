# Ueli Steck

Ueli is one of my mountaineering heroes. He's most famous for his [speed records on alpine north faces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOghf5uN794): sub-three hours on the Eiger, the Matterhorn, and the Grande Jorasses. He should be most famous for his climbs in the great ranges, particularly his [28-hour solo first ascent on the South Face of Annapurna](http://publications.americanalpineclub.org/articles/13201212552/Alone-on-Annapurna) in 2013. They called him the Swiss Machine.

Ueli Steck died on Nupste on April 30, 2017. Many wrote obituaries to remember him.
