# Hello World
Hi there! Welcome to my site. I'm a computer science student, unprofessional climber, and avid reader. See my about page for more.

This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Jekyll theme for hack.css](https://wemake.services/jekyll-theme-hackcss/). It's hosted on GitHub Pages. Check out my [source code](https://cordyceptive.github.io/)!
