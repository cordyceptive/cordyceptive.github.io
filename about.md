# Who am I?

I'm studying computer science and technology and society at Princeton, graduating spring 2020. This semester I'm working on an independent project titled *Multivariate Network Visualizations for Mountaineering History*, advised by Prof. Brian Kernighan. In the future I hope to research and write on technology history and policy.

I'm trying to learn more about software development. My favorite language at the moment is Python, though I'm also working on my C++ and Go. I hope to build powerful, functional, beautifully designed tools. Currently looking for an internship for summer 2019, if you're hiring!

I read almost compulsively. Some of my favorite topics are recent military history, science fiction, and and offbeat journalism. Check out my collections of bookmarks, books I've read, and my reading list (all in my notes) if you want to see what I'm up to.

I'm passionate about climbing mountains. I hope to climb some of the world's great alpine faces one day, so right now I'm trying to develop my skills on rock and ice.
